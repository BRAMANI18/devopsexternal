Git push results in "Authentication Failed"
Asked 11 years, 5 months ago

I have been using GitHub for a little while, and I have been fine with git add, git commit, and git push, so far without any problems. Suddenly I am having an error that says:

fatal: Authentication Failed

In the terminal I cloned a repository, worked on a file and then I used git add to add the file to the commit log and when I did git commit, it worked fine. Finally, git push asks for username and password. I put those in correctly and every time I do this, it says the same error.

What is the cause of this problem and how can I fix it?

The contents of .git/config are:

[core]
        repositoryformatversion = 0
        filemode = true
        bare = false
        logallrefupdates = true
[remote "origin"]
        url = http://www.github.com/######/Random-Python-Tests
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
[branch "master"]
        remote = origin
        merge = refs/heads/master
[user]
        name = #####
        email = ############

If you enabled two-factor authentication in your GitHub account you won't be able to push via HTTPS using your accounts password. Instead you need to generate a personal access token. This can be done in the application settings of your GitHub account. Using this token as your password should allow you to push to your remote repository via HTTPS. Use your username as usual.

Creating a personal access token

You may also need to update the origin for your repository if it is set to HTTPS. Do this to switch to SSH:

git remote -v
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:USERNAME/REPONAME.git

On Windows, try the below steps to edit or remove the saved credentials:

Click Start
Type: Credential Manager (on Windows 10, this is under "Start → Settings". Then search for "Credential Manager")
See the Windows Credentials Manager shortcut and double-click it to open the application.
Once the application is open, click on the Windows Credentials tab.
Locate the credentials that you want to remove/update. They will start with "git:" and might begin with "ada:"
Click on the credential entry. It will open a details view of the entry.
Click Edit or Remove as required and confirm.
Later rinse and repeat as necessary.

Fantastic answer. We maintain an internal BitBucket repository, where each of our account credentials are authenticated to our organization. Recently all of my repositories became unavailable for pushing code changes. While I had been able to change credentials on a case per case basis, I really did not want to do this for every project. @Pradeep's approach allowed me to solve the underlying cause, which was more than simply a password change. Our organization recently changed the name of the internal domain, so by editing the credentials centrally, I was able to fix all of my projects. –

Maybe you have changed the password recently for you Git account. You could try the git push line with the -u option:

git push -u origin branch_name_that_you_want_to_push
After executing the above command, it will ask for a password. Provide your updated password.

It happens if you change your login or password of git service account (Git). You need to change it in Windows Credentials Manager too. type "Credential Manager" in Windows Search menu open it.

Windows Credentials Manager->Windows Credential and under Generic Credentials edit your git password.

I gave wrong credentials when Git prompted me for user id and password while pushing new files to remote repository. When I ran push command again git did not prompt me for credentials but instead it was only throwing authentication failed error. I realised after reading this answer that git uses credentials stored in credential manager and that should be the reason git does not prompt for password everytime we push into remote respository. I deleted the git password in credential manager after which git again prompted me for user id and password. –

Basically my credential was expired, and I was facing the issue.

The following two commands helped me:

git config --global --unset credential.helper

git config credential.helper store
It will ask you for credentials next time when you try to push.

Follow the below guidelines for more details for secured and unsecured storage of the user name and passwords:

git-credential-store

git-credential-cache

Be careful with this command it will replace the real path to your credential helper with simply "wincred" which apparently not what you need. –

First, you can make sure to use the proper URL:

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/zkirkland/Random-Python-Tests.git
Then, if it was working before, and if it wasn't asking for your username, it must be because you had stored your credentials (login/password) in a $HOME/.netrc file, as explained here. You can double check those settings, and make sure that your proxy, if you have one, hasn't changed.

Check the output of git config --global credential.helper.
And make sure the credentials are your GitHub user account, and a PAT (Personal Access token).

You can update your credentials using the Git credential helper, as in here.

If that still doesn't work, you can switch to an SSH URL:

git remote set-url origin git@github.com:zkirkland/Random-Python-Tests.git
But that means you have published your SSH public key in your Account settings.

For Visual Studio Code specifically, see also "git push: Missing or invalid credentials. fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/username/repo.git'"

You can unselect the setting git.terminalAuthentication to avoid the error message.

On Windows, if you found an authentication error problem when you entered the correct password and username, it's a Git problem. To solve this problem, when you are installing the Git in your machine, uncheck the Enable Git Credential Manager option.

I was getting the same error. I tried all the solutions whichever mentioned in this page, but they didn't work. Finally, I found the solution.

These kinds of error comes if sometimes your system password has changed recently anytime. It will try to validate from the old password. So, follow these steps:

Go to Control Panel
Click on User Accounts
Under Credentials manager
Go to Manage Windows Credentials
Go to Generic Credentials
Expand the Git server tab
Click on Remove from vault
Also, you can click Edit and change your password stored here directly.

I think that for some reason GitHub is expecting the URL to NOT have subdomain www. When I use (for example)

git remote set-url origin https://www.github.com/name/repo.git
it gives the following messages:

remote: Anonymous access to name/repo.git denied
fatal: Authentication failed for https://www.github.com/name/repo.git
However, if I use

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/name/repo.git
it works perfectly fine. Doesn't make too much sense to me... but I guess remember not to put www in the remote URL for GitHub repositories.

Also notice the clone URLs provided on the GitHub repository webpage doesn't include the www.

I was adding to Bitbucket linked with Git and had to remove the stored keys, as this was causing the fatal error.

To resolve, I opened the command prompt and ran

 rundll32.exe keymgr.dll, KRShowKeyMgr
I removed the key that was responsible for signing in and next time I pushed the files to the repo, I was prompted for credentials and entered the correct ones, resulting in a successful push.

I've ran into

git fetch

fatal: Authentication failed for 'http://...."
after my Windows password had expired and was changed. Multiple fetches, reboot and even reinstall of Git with Windows Credential Manager didn't help.

Surprisingly the right answer is somewhere here in comments, but not in answers (and some of them are really weird!).

You need to go to Control Panel → Credential Manager → Windows Credentials and update you password for git:http://your_repository_address

I had the same problem. I set the URL in this way:

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/zkirkland/Random-Python-Tests.git

I also removed this entry from the configuration file: askpass = /bin/echo.

Then "git push" asked me for username and password and this time it worked.

If you have enabled the two-factor authentication on your GitHub account, then sign in to your GitHub account and go to

New personal access token

to generate a new access token, copy that token, and paste as a password for authentication in the terminal.

I started experiencing this issue on Visual Studio Code in Ubuntu 20.04 yesterday.

I did not make any changes to my GitHub credentials, neither did I change anything in the project, but I run any git command to communicate with my remote branch like:

git pull origin dev
I get the error below:

remote: Repository not found. fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/MyUsername/my-project.git/'

Here's what worked for me:

I tried recloning the project and then running the git pull command but it did not work.

git clone https://my-git-url
I tried setting my credentials again using the below commands but still no luck:

git config --global user.email "email@example.com"
git config --global user.name "John King"
I tried removing the remote repository and re-adding it using the below commands, but still no luck:

git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://my-git-url
Finally, I decided to try using my default Ubuntu terminal and it worked fine. My big guess is that it's a bug from Visual Studio Code from the last update that was made some few hours before then (See the screenshot that shows that a Release was done on the same day that I was having the issue). I mean I set up Visual Studio Code using snap, so probably it might have been updated in the background a few hours before then.

enter image description here

Hopefully, they will get it fixed and git remote operations will be fine again.

Having the same issues, VScode on ubuntu 20.04. Did you find a solution to make the integrated terminal to work? (I'm using bash) –

Just from your .config file change:

url = http://www.github.com/###user###/Random-Python-Tests
To:

url = http://###user###@github.com/###user###/Random-Python-Tests

The question was asked way before Two-Factor Authentication was introduced by GitHub, however, many people are encountering this error ever since GitHub introduced 2FA.

GitHub asks for authentication every time you try to push, if you want to avoid getting prompted repeatedly, you should use github-cli which is very lightweight and you can install with apt, yum, dnf and pacman.

after installing github-cli,

Type this command
gh auth login
Select the account type to authenticate
Select HTTPS or SSH (as desired)
Login with a web browser or authenticate with access tokens as per your ease.
Access tokens can be generated from GitHub > Settings > Developer-settings > Generate Access token, copy the token, and paste it into the terminal, It is a one-time code so ensure that you do not lose the code before authenticating it on the terminal

Got the above error message when I updated my computer password. Reset my git credentials using the following steps:

Go to Control Panel > User Accounts > Credential Manager > Windows Credentials. You will see Git credentials in the list (e.g. git:https://). Click on it, update the password, and execute git pull/push command from your Git bash and it won't throw any more error messages.

You're a lifesaver, I was just about to give up and send an email to Support when I saw this answer, since the same thing was happening to me (no clue why windows credentials didn't update automatically like the last time I had to change my computer password, but oh well). –

If you are on Windows and trying to push to a Windows server which has domain users working as repository users (TFS), try getting into the TFS URL (i.e. http:\\tfs) with Internet Explorer. Enter your domain account credentials and let the page appear.

Caution: Only use Internet Explorer! Other browsers won’t change your system credentials.

Now go to Git Bash and change your remote user for the repository like below:

git config user.name "domainName\userName"
And done. Now you can push!

For me it worked in windows10+scoop+cmder by configuring the windows credential manager:

git config credential.helper manager
git push

I tried the token verification method and got it to work ~3 times and wasted around 2 hours of time for that. For some reason it does not work very well for our company.

My solution was to change the authentication method from HTTPS to SSH. Here is a Github guide (https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).

After you have created the SSH key, remember to change the SSH address origin:

git remote add origin git@github.com:user/repo.git

I was getting below error when trying to push to github remote

git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
Solution SSH Keys were missing on github account

Copy local public ssh keys from ~/.ssh directory

Paste to Github > Settings > SSH and GPG Keys > New SSH Key

Try ssh -T git@github.com This should output

Hi xxxxx! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

What does option -T do in ssh? And why is it not listed here ssh.com/academy/ssh/command#ssh-command-line-options? – 
Thiago Gouvea
 CommentedOct 8, 2021 at 9:44
The -T option will disable pseudo terminal allocation while connecting to a Git remote server over SSH. Git server will respond to SSH request having -T option. –

For me, I forgot that I had changed the password on github.com, and my keychain for shell authentication never updated to that new password.

Deleting everything Git from my keychain and then rerunning the Git request helped solve the issue, prompting me again for the new password.

If you are using SSH and cloned with HTTPS, this will not work.

Clone with SSH and then push and pulls should work as expected!

the quick GUI way of doing is:

Firstly generate an access token via create app access token.
then goto sourceTree's Settings(placed under the close button of the Source tree)
A prompt will appear named "Repository Settings".
There add/edit your repository path with https://USER_NAME:ACCESS_TOKEN@bitbucket.org/REPO_NAME/PROJECT_NAME.git
or for github account

https://username:access-token@github.com/username/repo.git

Here the only change to mention is adding the additional accessToken generated by the above shared create app access token link into existing path url.

In my case, I was using the password for DevOps login when Git request password after user has ben entered; I was wrong since I needed to enter password provided with the creation of Personal Access Token (PAT) - that password shows a warning that it must be copied, since won't be shown again -. In summary, provide Git credentials as user and pwd showed in that creation step. –
