When you see this message, it means that the SSH client on your computer has not connected to GitHub before, and therefore does not recognize GitHub's server as a trusted host.

The message provides the fingerprint of GitHub's SSH key (in this case, an ED25519 key), which is a cryptographic fingerprint that you can verify for security. If the fingerprint matches what GitHub publishes, it's safe to proceed.

To continue:

Verify the fingerprint:

You can check GitHub's official SSH key fingerprints to confirm it's legitimate. GitHub's SSH key fingerprints for ED25519 are:
ruby
Copy code
SHA256:+DiY3wvvV6TuJJhbpZisF/zLDA0zPMSvHdkr4UvCOqU
You can also visit GitHub's SSH key page for verification:
GitHub SSH Key Fingerprints.
If the fingerprint matches and you're confident that it's correct, you can type yes and press Enter to continue. This will add GitHub's key to your list of known hosts, so you won't see this message again the next time you interact with GitHub over SSH.

Example:

bash
Copy code
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
If you type yes, Git will then add GitHub's key to the list of known hosts (~/.ssh/known_hosts), and your connection should proceed normally.

If you ever see a different fingerprint or if you're unsure about the authenticity, you should be cautious and verify that the server you're connecting to is indeed GitHub.
